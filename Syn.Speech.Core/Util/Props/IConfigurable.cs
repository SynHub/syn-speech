/**
/// Defines the interface that must be implemented by any configurable component in Sphinx-4.  The life cycle of a
/// component is as follows:
/// <p/>
/// <ul><li> <b>Class Parsing</b> The class file is parsed in order to determine all its configurable properties.  These
/// are defined using <code>public static final String</code> fields which are annotated with one of the following
/// annotations: <ul> <li>S4Integer <li>S4Double <li>S4Boolean <li>S4Component <li>S4ComponentList </ul> Further
/// informations about property-specific fields can be found in the javadoc of the property-annotation-definitions. Only
/// names of annotated properties will be allowed by the configuration system later on.
/// <p/>
/// <li> <b>Construction</b> - The (empty) component constructor is called in order to instantiate the component.
/// Typically the constructor does little, if any work, since the component has not been configured yet.
/// <p/>
/// <li> <b> Configuration</b> - Shortly after instantiation, the component's <code>newProperties</code> method is
/// called. This method is called with a <code>PropertySheet</code> containing the properties (usually taken from an
/// external configuration file). The component should extract the properties from the property sheet. If some properties
/// defined for a component does not fulfill the property definition given by the annotation (type, range, etc.) a
/// <code>PropertyException</code> is thrown. Typically, once a component gets its configuration data via the
/// <code>newData</code> method, the component will initialize itself.
/// <p/>
/// Note: In most cases <code>newProperties</code> is called only once as a result of system configuration during
/// startup. But nevertheless it is possible (and sometimes necessary) to reconfigure a component while it's running.
/// Therefore, a well behaved component should react properly to multiple <code>newProperties</code> calls. </ul>
/// <p/>
/// <p><b>Connecting to other components</b> <p> Components often need to interact with other components in the system.
/// One of the design goals of Sphinx-4 is that it allows for very flexible hook up of components in the system.
/// Therefore, it is *not* considered good S4 style to hardcode which subcomponents a particular subcomponent is
/// interacting with.  Instead, the component should use the configuration manager to provide the hook up to another
/// component.
/// <p/>
/// For example, if a component needs to interact with a Linguist. Instead of explicitly setting which linguist is to be
/// used via a constructor or via a <code>setLinguist</code> call, the component should instead define a configuration
/// property for the linguist.  This would be done like so:
/// <p/>
/// <code> <pre>
///     \@S4Component(type=Linguist.class)
///     public static string PROP_LINGUIST = "linguist";
/// </pre> </code>
/// <p> The linguist is made available in the <code>newProperties</code> method, like so: <p>
/// <code> <pre>
///     public void newProperties(PropertySheet propertySheet) {
///      linguist = (Linguist) propertySheet.getComponent(PROP_LINGUIST);
///     }
/// </pre> </code>
/// <p/>
/// This <code>getComponent</code> call will find the proper linguist based upon the configuration data.  Thus, if the
/// configuration for this component had the 'linguist' defined to be 'dynamicLexTreeLinguist', then the configuration
/// manager will look up and return a linguist with that name, creating and configuring it as necessary.  Of course, the
/// dynamicLexTreeLinguist itself may have a number of sub-components that will be created and configured as a result. If
/// the component doesn't exist (but was defined to mandatory) and no configuration information is found in the config
/// file for it, or if it is of the wrong type, a <code>PropertyException</code> will be thrown.
